Steps for generating timetable:

1. Take required data [done]

	a. class
	b. faculty
	c. shift
	d. total section
	e. total period
	f. days
	g.optinal subject gap
	
2. Make a list carring tuple of rows and cols and sort it for each section in a dict [done]
	FOR EXAMPLE: dict_1={ 'section': [ (row, col) ] }

3. Retrive teachers (short name) from data base and sort it to a dict_2 (having subjects as keys and teacher as values)

NOTE: dicts in step 3 and step 4 must have the same keys (easy to merger data)

4. Retrive subject from data base and sort it to a dict_3 (having subject as keys and their sub units ad values) 

5. Merge datas from step 3 and step 4:

	a. choose subjects sequence wise

	b. choose teacher randomly

	c. choose sections randomly

	d. make a dict of these data 
		FOR EXAMPLE: dict_4={'subject':[teacher,(sections...)]}

6. Use these datas to put into the table:

	a. hold the suject from dict_4 to a variable

	b. hold teacher from dict_4 to a variable

	c. go to the selected sections and choose (row,col) from dict_1

	d. use datas of step a, b, c and place them in right order.
