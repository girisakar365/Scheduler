# MSchool Sample

This branch specifically contains the sample form of the application. 
Here some of the ideas were test to make sure wheather these ideas might run or not.


## File Usage: 

To use the code is actually very easy. A python framework named 'PyQt5' is required to run the whole program successfully.
The <b> init.py </b> initilazies the whole program. So after cloning the branch you may directly run that file.

### Framework installation:
  pip install PyQt5
  
  Further Information: [Documentation](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/)
